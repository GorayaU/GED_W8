## Reflection

### Dirty Flag
The text for the fuel UI gets updated when the value is changed, instead of every frame
### Object Pooling
The enemy cars are in a list, after a certain amount of time they get de activated, set to another position then re activated. instead of the old system where i would create an distory game objects every time.
